# Tasman

Tasman is a comprehensive project that aims to resolve the problem that people nowadays tend to overload too many tasks. It is also designed specifically to avoid burnouts, especially for workers, university students. It is an efficient and helpful piece of software that is able to create new tasks, set the due date for the task, check the current status of specific tasks, and  many more features when diving into the web app. This project is divided into two main components: Backend and Frontend.
